# Mid-Project-Housing-Regression-Model

The purpose of this repository is build a model that represents me as me working as an analyst for a real estate company. Your company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

Your job is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. Senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.

## Description

You will find files within attached to varias documents from various programs such as Tableau, Jupyter Notebook, powerpoint, and MYQL.
With such files I intened to build a presentation based on the Data Set provided and the objective at hand.

I Executed the code in jupyter notebook using Python, in this code is the process to creating and finally the result of the Linear Regression Model
You will find bar graphs and plots in tableau to visually examplify the data insights that I have gathered.
There is a set of questions in jupyter notebook that were provided with an expected answer. Here you will find those questions and the answers.
A powerpoint presentation bringing it all together is provided as well.
